Study 1  BP Intervention using Diet and Lifestyle, Study 2 Blood Pressure using medical intervention using R

Study 1: Diet and Lifestyle Interventions
The analysis should be conducted in R, with appropriate output included in Appendix 1, taking
care to label your output for the appropriate questions. You should justify your chosen statistical
methodology in the methods and summarise the findings in the results section of your report, using
appropriate tables and figures, which should be referred to in the text.
The first study is looking at lifestyle and dietary interventions to reduce blood pressure levels in
obese adults. Blood pressure levels were taken six months after patients were randomised to one of
five interventions. All patients had similar blood pressure levels of around 180mmHg at baseline.
The data can be found in the file ”BP Intervention.csv”. The study contains the following variables:
 Blood Pressure: The patient’s blood pressure in mmHg after six months
 Sex: The patient’s biological sex listed as Male or Female
 Intervention: The intervention the patient was assigned to. There were five interventions:
A Moderate exercise programme, medium salt dietary intervention
B Moderate exercise intervention only
C No intervention
D Low-salt dietary intervention
E Low-salt dietary intervention, moderate exercise intervention
(a.) State the study design
(b.) Present appropriate numerical and visual summaries of the data and comment on these.
(c.) Fit an appropriate statistical model to the data, and comment on the significance of the effects.
(d.) Assess the validity of this model.
(e.) Carry out an appropriate statistical procedure to investigate any significant differences in
blood pressure after the five interventions. Are any interventions preferable to the others?
Present appropriate numerical and visual summaries of these results.

Study 2: Medical Intervention for Blood Pressure
The analysis should be conducted in R, with appropriate output included in Appendix 2, taking
care to label your output for the appropriate questions. You should justify your chosen statistical
methodology in the methods and summarise the findings in the results section of your report, using
appropriate tables and figures, which should be referred to in the text.
The study is investigating if a new drug can reduce blood pressure in obese patients. 20 patients were
each assigned to three groups – one receiving the new drug (group 1), one receiving the currently
prescribed drug (group 2), and one receiving no drug (group 3). The patients are assessed at baseline,
after one month, and after 2 months. The data can be found in the file ”blood pressure.csv”. The
study contains the following variables:
 Participant: The patient ID
 Drug: Whether the participant was assigned the old, new, or no drug
 Time: The time of the measurement: Baseline, or after one month, or two months
 Blood Pressure: The participant’s blood pressure in mmHg
(a.) State the study design
(b.) Present appropriate numerical and visual summaries of the data and comment on these.
(c.) Fit an appropriate statistical model to determine if there are any differences in blood pressure
over time or between treatment groups. Present appropriate numerical and visual summaries
of these results.
(d.) Assess the validity of this model.
(e.) Determine the proportion of variance explained by the patient differences and comment on
this.
